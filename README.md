This is my basic portfolio project for intern or junior java developer positions. Please note that I am a beginner and a huge part of code in this repo needs refactor and could be done better / differently.

## Description

The airport management API database consists of below tables:

    - id - Integer
    - name - String
    - active - Boolean
