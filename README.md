## Introduction

This is my basic portfolio project for intern or junior java developer positions. Please note that I am a beginner and a huge part of code in this repo needs refactor and could be done better / differently.

## Description

The airport management API database consists of below tables:
1. Carriers
    1. id - Integer
    2. name - String
    3. active - Boolean
